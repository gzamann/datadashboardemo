# About
App is initialized with a simple create-react-app boilerplate.
## Component structure
There are two directories created for components
1. src/components - Contains the components used in the UI (Chart.jsx, Filter.jsx)
2. src/pages - Contains individual pages and their layout (Dashboard)

#### About Components
  **Chart** - This component is a wrapper for the echarts. Echarts can be used through our wrapper component so that we have a standard way to use Echarts across the project and all the configurations, modification etc are applied here when required.
  
  **Filters** - This component contains the date, age and gender filters. It handles the states for all the filter components and the logic to handle any updates. Upon update, this component generates filtered data and updates to the parent component which is our Dashboard.

## Data
- The API data is fetched in the page level with useEffect hook (Dashboard.jsx)
- Local states for data are maintained at the page level (Dashboard.jsx)
- API fetching and data storing is handled within the component since state management is not in place for the demo app

## Constants and Utilities
Constants and utilities are stored in **src/utils**. These can be imported and used through the app.

**constants.js**  - Contains all the app constants such as Filter labels and options.

**appUtils.js** - Contains all the utility functions for that are used in the app and these can be re-used in further development. Currently stored in a single file, but we would store utils by modules and common when the app grows.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
