# About

This is a simple React application initialized with create-react-app.

## Component Structure

### Components Directory (`src/components`)

- **Chart.jsx**: A reusable component that wraps around Echarts for consistent chart display and configuration across the application.
  
- **Filter.jsx**: Contains date, age, and gender filters. Manages filter states and logic for updating data displayed on the `Dashboard`.

### Pages Directory (`src/pages`)

- **Dashboard.jsx**: Integrates charts and filters to display relevant data in a dashboard layout.

## About Components

### Chart Component

The `Chart` component simplifies the integration of Echarts throughout the app. It provides a standardized approach for configuring and displaying various types of charts.

### Filters Component

The `Filters` component handles user interactions with date, age, and gender filters. It manages state changes and updates data displayed on the `Dashboard` based on user selections.

## Data Handling

Data fetching from APIs is managed within the `Dashboard.jsx` component using the `useEffect` hook. Local state management within `Dashboard.jsx` ensures efficient data updates and rendering.

## Constants and Utilities

Constants and utility functions are stored in `src/utils`.

- **constants.js**: Houses application-wide constants such as filter labels and options for consistent use across components.
  
- **appUtils.js**: Contains utility functions that facilitate common tasks across the application. As the app grows, utilities will be organized by modules to maintain scalability and clarity.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
